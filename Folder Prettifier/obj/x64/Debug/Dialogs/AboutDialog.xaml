        <TextBlock TextWrapping="WrapWholeWords">
            The application is meant to provide an ease in the management of
            folders. There're sitautions where we have a huge amount of files
            in our folders &amp; we want them to be well organised. But if you
            do it manually then it may hours or even a whole day. This manual
            task can be achieved with the help of a software like this.
