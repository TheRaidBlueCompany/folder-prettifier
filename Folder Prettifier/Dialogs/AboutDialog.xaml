        <TextBlock TextWrapping="WrapWholeWords">
            The application is meant to provide an ease in the management of
            folders. There're sitautions where we have a huge amount of files
            in our folders &amp; we want them to be well organised. But if you
            do it manually then it may hours or even a whole day. This manual
            task can be achieved with the help of a software like this.

        <TextBlock FontSize="20" FontWeight="Medium" Margin="0,15,0,5">The History</TextBlock>
        <TextBlock TextWrapping="WrapWholeWords">
            At start, this software was meant just for folder management but
            now it supports a large amount of great features that will surely
            help a person whose data is very precious. At present, it support
            cloud sync, auto folder management, backup, file &amp; folder
            encryption instead of just basic management.

        <TextBlock FontSize="20" FontWeight="Medium" Margin="0,15,0,5">Role as a developer</TextBlock>
        <TextBlock TextWrapping="WrapWholeWords">
            This is software is meant to be used with ease &amp; free. From the
            developer's perspective this is made almost stable for the end-user.
            But in case someone finds a bug please report it this is the only
            way to improve this. Rolling as a developer is a great experience as
            helping people is a great feeling!
