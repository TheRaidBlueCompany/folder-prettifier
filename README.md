# FOLDER PRETTIFIER

### Simple to use program to make your messy folder clean good to look.

This project *aims* the mid-level user ring to manage their files with ease. Sometimes the folder becomes very messy and it becomes very much `difficult to manage` them or separate them. So, this program can `help` in resolving that.

#### It can perform the following operations-
* **Capitalizes** the names of files.
* **Corrects** the spacing errors in the text files.
* **Corrects** the casing errors after the end of the line.
* **Categorizes** the files according to their type (extension).
